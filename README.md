Repository containing my work for UofM's FinTech Bootcamp. Module 4.

Use quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas, and you want to determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

Create an analysis notebook to visualize the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. 

- Prepare the Data
- Perform Quantitative Analysis
- Create a Custom Portfolio


Note: In the calculation and plotting portion of beta (towards the middle of the notebook), I followed the class guide and ended up with redundant code, so I cleaned it up after I  understood how to use it.
